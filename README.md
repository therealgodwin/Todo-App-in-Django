# Todo-App-in-Django
This app is made in Django with complete user login and registration. You can't find any css files because this app is made with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) and inline css in the template files.

**App Logic**
- When you open the website, you will be redirected first to the Registration Page, it has also a Login button if you're a new user.
- It has validation, but feel free to make it your own with your custom validation logic.
- When you first register as a new user, you are then assigned your own Todo. This acts as a container for each task that you're going to add later on.
- Each user has a different Todo (task container) so even if you log out and log back in, your tasks still stay in place. You can also delete them if you want. Don't worry that feature is already there.

**Feel free to use this app or edit this app to your needs.**
